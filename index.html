<p>Please take time to read the following important guidance before committing any code to the Met Office GitHub:</p>

<p>Before using either public or private repositories at <a href="https://github.com/MetOffice">https://github.com/MetOffice</a>, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that your Information Asset Owner (IAO) has agreed that it is acceptable to host your source code on GitHub, that there is no risk to the reputation or operational effectiveness of the Met Office through loss of this intellectual property and that that an appropriate software licencing model has been agreed.</p>

<ul>
<li>You should ensure that you maintain a record of this agreement with your IAO - an email conversation is acceptable</li>
<li>You confirm that anything you post at <a href="https://github.com/MetOffice">https://github.com/MetOffice</a> is classed as below Official â€“ Sensitive</li>
<li>Choose the appropriate location for your source code on <a href="https://github.com/MetOffice">https://github.com/MetOffice</a>: remember that anything placed in a <strong>public</strong> repository will be available publically to all Internet users and that by default you will have accepted GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> which allow those users to view, fork (and by definition modify) your source code</li>
<li>Once agreement on an appropriate software licencing model has been reached with your IAO, reference to that licence should be included with the software on GitHub.  Please look at the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing#where-does-the-license-live-on-my-repository">following page</a> for information on how to include this licence on a GitHub repository.</li>
