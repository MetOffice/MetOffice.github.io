<li>Choose the appropriate location for your source code on <a href="https://github.com/MetOffice">https://github.com/MetOffice</a>: remember that anything placed in a <strong>public</strong> repository will be available to any GitHub user and that by default you will have accepted GitHub's Terms of Service which allow those users to view and fork your repository</li>
